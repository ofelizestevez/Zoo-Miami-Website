                <h2>10 Interesting Facts</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><h3>The Early Days of the Zoo</h3>
                    <p>This history of the zoo goes back to 1948. A circus went out of business and Miami, and they left a few lions, an elephant, and a rhinoceros behind. The founders of the zoo used a 48-acre park that they called the Crandon Park Zoo. It was located on the island of Key Biscayne, just off the coast of Miami. It is what got the zoo started and it also saved the lives of the animals that the circus left behind.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>What the Zoo Has Become</h3>
                    <p>Today, the zoo spans over 750 acres of land. It is home to over 3,000 animals and there are over 500 different species. Of the entire animal population, there are over 40 species who are considered to be endangered. There is more to the zoo than its animals. Today, there are over 1,000 species of palms, trees, and other plants.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>About the Zoo</h3>
                    <p>The Miami Zoo is also known as the Miami-Dade Zoological Park and Gardens. It is the largest and oldest zoo in the state of Florida. Also, it is the only sub-tropical zoo in the continental United States. Thanks to Florida’s unique climate, this zoo is able to house a variety of different animals from different countries, including Australia, Africa, and Asia.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Animal Placement</h3>
                    <p>Each of the animals in the zoo is put into groups based on the geographic territories of their natural habitat. The animals that live together peacefully out in the wild are placed in exhibits together at the zoo. They try to make the habitat as natural as if they were living in the wild. Even the trees, the foliage, and the soil is as closely matched to what these animals would be around if they were living in the wild. It is also one of the first free-range zoos in the United States. This means that all of the exhibits are entirely cageless. You can’t get any closer to seeing these animals in their natural habitat than this unless you actually traveled to their homeland.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>The Zoo Main Attractions</h3>
                    <p>There is more to the Miami Zoo than just walking around and checking out the animals. There are a variety of attractions to visit as well. Some of the most popular attractions include the Children’s Zoo, the Samburu Giraffe Feeding Station, the Sami Fami Amphitheater, The Rhino Encounter, and the Parrot Feeding Adventure. There are plenty of things to do at the zoo, so much so, that you may need to make two separate trips to the zoo if you are going to see it all.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Cooling Off at the Zoo</h3>
                    <p>Anyone who has been to Florida, especially in the summer knows that it gets really hot during the day. If you get too hot visiting the animals and the exhibits, you can visit the water play areas. The water play area contains a variety of fountains for the kids to run through and overfilling buckets that will dump on them. There are even smaller play areas for very young children. If you get hot while walking through the park, there are several mist stations located throughout the park to keep you cool.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Hours and Pricing</h3>
                    <p>The zoo is open 365 days a year, even on Christmas and Thanksgiving, however, the hours on these days are different. The park is open on Thanksgiving Day from 10am to 4pm and on Christmas Day from 12pm to 5pm. The rest of the year the park is open from 10am until 5pm, and the last tickets sold would be at 4pm. Zoo members and children under 2 years old get in free. Children between 3 and 12 years old get in for $17.95 and everyone over 13 years old would pay $21.95. Considering everything that the zoo has to offer, the prices are very reasonable.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>The Miami Zoo Educates</h3>
                    <p>One of the goals of the Miami Zoo is to educate. Hundreds of thousands of children have visited the zoo on a field trip. They also offer one hour long Wildlife Discovery Classroom Programs, where you can learn about the animal families, the classification of the animals, how the zoo thrives and survives, and all about the animals diet and lifestyles. If you and your family love animals and they want to know more about them, these classes are great. The zoo also has a mobile learning van. They will go out to schools, parties, summer camps, and any other function where there are children who want to be educated. These vans carry reptiles for the kids to hold, small animals, and games for the kids to play. The mobile zoo is a great addition to any function.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>They Have a Mission Statement</h3>
                    <p>The mission statement written by the Miami Zoo states that it strives to encourage an appreciation of the world’s wildlife. It also says that they want to help to conserve plants and wildlife for future generations to enjoy.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><h3>They Are Partners With Amazon</h3>
                    <p>The Miami Zoo has partnered up with Amazon. If you make an eligible AmazonSmile purchase, Amazon will donate 0.05 percent of the price to the charity of your choice.</p>
